## What is a web server? Hardware and software side
* Hardware side: A web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. A web server connects to the internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
* Software side: A web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs and HTTP. An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
